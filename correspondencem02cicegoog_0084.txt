thus he gave curio matter for declamation before the people. This
appears to be what caelus means (Fam. viii. ll. l. Ep. cclxvii.)
when, speaking as a Pompeian, he alludes to ‘the advantage Ourio
had gained bythe mad conduct ofPaullus' (quodsurcre Paulli adep-

by Curio, in which he attached violently the whole of Pompeius'
second consulship. Suetonius (Rhet. l) tells us that iu order to
answer attacks of this kind Pompeius began to brush up bis deela-
matory vein of rhetoric, which had become rusty during the long
years of his primacy in the city. 'Phe State had no peace nor
quietness during the recess cf the Quinquatrus (Fam. ii. 12. 1,
Ep. cclxiii). The most important outcome, however, of the whole
tnrmoil was that Pompeius appears to have expressed as his view
that Caesar should be allowed to stand for the consulship in his
absence, bnt that he should be compelled tc resign his command cu
the Ides cf November, 705 (49). This seemed very indulgent on
Pompeius’ past. A grem deal was granted to Caesar-permission
to stand for the consulship in his absence, aud only a bare six
weeks ci private life, and that as consul designate, before he
entered on the consulship. He would uo doubt be accused during
these six weshs; but he must, Pompeius might argue, and it is
only reasonable that he should, face bis accusatione like any other
man. Pompeius could represent to himself and tc the world that
he was acting in as fair a manner as possible towards his old friend
by proposing that the interval between the resignation of his
military command and his entry on the consulship should be so
short. In these moves and countermoves where it was everything
to gain show cf fairness, this was a very plausible proposa13 though
in reality six weehs would have been quite, long enough tc effect
