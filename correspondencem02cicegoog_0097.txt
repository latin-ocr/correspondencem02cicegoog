‘the slow and ineffioient person‚’ ³ was so brow-beaten that ha

and ooereed by the violent language ol tho oonsuls, the terror of
Pompeius’ army and the threats of his friends, voted ior what
Metellus Seipio had recommended—tlrat Caesar should dismiss his
army before a fixed day, and that, if he refused, he should bs
