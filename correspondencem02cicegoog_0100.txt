53. Horis POLITIOS OF THE PERI 01). xor

wa must not blind ourselves to the sides of ansar’s aharaoter
whioh are open to grave oensure. We ure not by any means
minded to fall down and worship the golden image whioh Momm·
sen, the king, hath set up. To us Caesar appears ona oi the most
fortunate ot men, and tte most eonsummate and varied intelleot
that aver lived: but he had no moral nature. All his seemingly
genereus aetions would appear to havebeen direoted by calculatione
of expedienoy. Ha was a hard man, and, like Napoleon, seems
never to have been able to make or keep friends: he had lieutensnts
and subordinatas in plenty, but friends none. Most ot his equals
feared him, all respeetad him, none loved him. In the means he
adopted to obtain his ends, he did not risa one inoh above the ordi-
narymorality of tha day; he was baset by enemies, no doubt, who

were even more unsorupulous than he was3 but we must remember
that he did not hesitate to stoop to bribery and corruption on the
most extendad soale, perhaps, that the world has ever seen, and to
any kind of low daoaption that he thought would advenae his pur·
possa* Tha end, tra and, justified to him tha means3 and the

waiulness, rafleetian, anergy: for many years ba had set his hesrt on royal power and
virt great teil and through many dsngsrs affected what he had purposed3 by shows
and buildings, b ylargessas and ieastings ba had soothed the passione of the ignorant
crowd: ha attached to his sida his partisans by rewards‚ his anemies by tha show ol
elameney. 1n a werdhe angendared in tha State than frea, partly by its tear, partly
by andnranee, me babit ol submissim) This is a fine tribute to the genius of a fallen
tas, aad as surh reminds us of the outburst by Tennyson's William ovar tha dead
body ot finale:-

mmmmm
A Christian burisl: yet ha wasa warrior
And wisa, yaa truthhrl, till that blighted row
Wbieh God avenged to day.

I thought that all was lost. Sinas I knew battle,

And thet was from my boybood‚ naver yat—

No, by tha splendour of God-hara I fought men ,
Like Harold and his brethren, and his guard

Fall where ha stood. They loved him: and, pray (iod
My Normans may but move as true with ms

To tha door oi daath.
