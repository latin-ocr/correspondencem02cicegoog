18611111 regard to the syncopated forms cf the perfect stem when
that stem is formed by a suffix r, (laelius for the most part follows
what was the muel practice. 'l'his is described by Rcby ἐξ 660-1,
aa follows 2-A11 forms are syncopated except in lst sing, 3rd

sing, lst plu. cl the perfect3 there arc occasional exceptione like
audieram, dno, audiero, dac, such forms being especially found in

the case cipeto, eo, and their oompounds: nocero always, but
morcaro, ocrim, acris ; in desino, pelo, ao, and compcunds the
omission of o usually (in the compcnnds 01 eo almost always) takes
place in the excepted persons3 in other verbs with -i stsms, -ἰίέ
is sometimes found, -r'r' hardly ever, -a'r'maa never. This practice
Ocelim for the most part follows. The only full forms he uses
arc: 6.1, existimaveram aper·arcrat; 8. 1, audior ,· 16. 1, copae-
ren'm. But (laelius generally uses the syncopatsd forms, such as
1. 4, carpat-aar ; 15. l, arrdiatr' ,· though he not unfrequently uses
the nnsyncopated forms with the r omitted, e. p. 4. 4, decr'eramas;
8. 10, petii ; 9, 3, arcessierit ,· 10. 1, aeratam 12. 2, resciit ; 16. 4,
nacarat. In the second person sing. of passive tenses, just as
Cicero dces, Caelius uses the form ·rr'a in the pres. indic: 8. 2, ad·
miraris ; 11. 4, aaapr'carr'a. In the present subjunctive Oicsro gene·

rally uses ·re, Roby ς 570. (laelius has 4. l, mirere, but 6. 1,
ridearis ,⁴ 10. 2, dicaris. As tc the terminaticn -era ior -auar in
the 3rd plural perf. ind. act, ‘there is hardly a sound example of
-are in any really good MS. cf Cicero cr Caesar' (Reid ap. Cio.
Orat. 157 ad. Sandys), and Caelius never uses it.
