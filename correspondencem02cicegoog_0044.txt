52. MARCUS OAELIUS RUFUS. xxxix

tiosl mettere, ‘Iheve never,' he seid (Fam. ii. 8. 1, Ep. oei), ‘in
the whole oourse of my life met enyone who is mors ou fait et poli·
tiosl questions (πολιτικώτερον),’ end eooordingly he esked him not

merely to ebroniole the events but slso to oritioise them. ‘Itis not
' the pest or the present Ι went from you, but, es you ore e men
who osn see fer ehsed, the future' (iu). And to e pieoe of ex·

oseding good fortune* we owe the preservation of most ol the
letters ‘written by Coelius during those interesting months, which ere

invulusble for the history of the time, end give us further every
oleer ides of the personel ohersoteristios of Coelius, while they show
us how very inferiores e stylist this most interesting of Oioero's
oorrespondents wes to the mester himself. Το some of the letters
of Coelius we heve Oioero's replies, end the letter oerteiuly heve
none of the roughnsss end jerhiness† whioh oberaoterize the oom-
positions of the younger end more exeiteble men. But though
no grem stylist, (laelius wes no inconsiderable personage ou the
stege of publio life et this period3 end it will not be out of pleoe
here to give e slight sketoh of his oereer end ohsreoter.

Mersus Coelius Rufus was the son of s Romen knight who was
e benher et Puteoli. He wes born, eooording to Pliny (H. Ν.
vii. 165), ou the seme dsy es Licinius Calvus, ths 28th of May,
672 (82). This dete is, however, very unoertsiu, beoouse Caelius
wes quaestor et the very latest in 698 (56), probably in 697 (57),
end the lowest ege for admission to this magistreoy was thirty3
so he oennot possibly hove been born later thsn 669 (85)ss As
his father destined him for u politiool osreer he brought him et
the ege of fifteen or sixteen to Rome, end entrusted him to the
ehsrge of Gioero end Oressus. It wes the prestioe of the time to
thus apprentioe, ss it were, young men who were destined lor publio
lile to distinguished oratore end stetesmen. These they followed to
the oourts eud to the forum, snd ssw in resl life end eotuol foot

⁸ But, es in everything, surgit amari aliquid-unfortunately the text of these most
diffienlt lettere is very oonupt, sod hss been little emended by commentatore. We
heve, therefore, to usk the indulgence of the render for our commentsry on them.

† 'l'he authores the Dialogus on Oraton (o. 21) notioes es s merli oi Oselius’ style
sem composition inconditi umus.
