house was not large enough to admit 01 0 decree being passed.
Few Senators attended during the unhealthy months 01 the year.
Pompeius, however, was present, and said that there was no need
1010 senatusconsultum just then: and Scipio, the father-inlaw

of Pompeius, who was all through these transactione the mouth·
piece used by the 101101 when he did not want 10 commit himself,

or when, holding the inperium, he could not attend inside the city, ·

urged that tho question 01 Caesar's succession should be fixed for
the ensuing 11101 01 March, and that no other subject should be
brought before the Senate on that day-a motion which gravely
disturbed ansar‘s friend, Cornelius Balbus, and led him to make
a complaint to Scipio* During the month 01 September the

full house, and that the Senate should continue to sit even during
eomitial days till the question was settled. This motion, as pre-
judging nothing, was left unassailed by Vibius Pansa and the
other Caesarina tribunes, and accordingly passed into law.

But not so the other proposals, 110. (2) that any impediment,
