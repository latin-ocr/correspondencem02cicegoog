his business in Asia· But it is more dignified lor Magnus to aot
through an agent3 his agent is Cluvius. “
Other great personages too find their way into the letters 01
this period, and show 00 0116 readers 01 0110 correspondenoe a very
different 1000 from that which they usually present to history.

Cato, it will be remembered‚ ahietly through the influenee 01
Clodius, who wanted to get him out 01 the way, was entrusted
with the commission 01 settling the affairs 01 Ptolemy the Cyprian.
Egypt and the 10111010 01 Cyprus, the last 010116 eonqnests 01 0116
Lagidae, had been beqneathed to Rome by the testament 01
Alexander Π. But the Senate was not desirous 01 annexing
Egypt, the position and finaneial organisation 01 whieh would
have inrested a Roman Coremor with powers whioh seemed
formidable to the suspioious and feeble govemment 010110 oli·
garehy.l The two illegitimate sons 01 Κ10οΙ1001101110,Ρο01611101
the Flute-player, and Ptolemy the Cyprian, were allowed to take
possession 1600000110101 01 Egypt and Cyprus. The Pluto-player
was permitted to buy 011 0000100100 101 0116 sum 01 6000 talenta
(1‚460‚0002.). His brother was too penurious to part with suoh a
very large ransom, or perhaps he doubted whether the Senate
would keep luith with him alter he had paid the money. At all
events, the annexation 01 Cyprus was deereed by 0116 000016 in the
year 58 (696), and M. Cato was deputed 00 060016 0116 affairs 01
Ptolemy. This weah-minded usurper‚ on hearing that the Roman
people had resolred 00 take his affairs in hand, put an end to
himself-perhaps, indeed, sensibly enough. The sale 011110 goods,
whioh Cato entrusted to his nephew Brutus, realized nearly 7000
talenta (1,700,000l.)‚ asum whioh would 11016 more than suffioed
to fill the maw 01 0110 Senate if the King oould have persuaded
himself to spend it in bribes. Brutus himself brought the money
to Rome; but poor Cata, aeeording to Plutaroh,† was the viatim
01 Fortune’s most oruel spite. He had made, as bound hy law,
two oopies 01 the 0000111100 01 0116 whole transaotion, whioh would
have proved [thinks Plutaroh) that not a draehma or sesteroe 01
the ill-fated usurper's accumulations had stuek to the flngers 01
