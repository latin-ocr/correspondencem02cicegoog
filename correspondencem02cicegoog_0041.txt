eheoh any symptoms of revolt inclinis, and to keep the feudatory

and allied sovereigns in tranquillity and good humour. All this he
sueoeeded in doing with hardly any support from Rome, though
he tried to gain it even by appealing to the eupidity of the mliug
oligarehs. In a letter to the donata* he reminds them ol the
terrible oonsequenoes oi losing provinoes ‘on whioh depend the
revenues of Rome;' but even to their eupidity he appeeled in vain.
Yet in these diffioult oireumstanees the measures whioh he took to

tius,† ‘of my prino-money no one has touohod or will toueh a
penny, save the urban quaestore, thetis, the Roman people.'

It is characteristio oi the whole spirit of this epooh oi Roman ⁵
history that Cicero lefled to seoure a triumph, ohiefly through the
opposition oi Cato, who, in a letterss of ponderous pedantry,
