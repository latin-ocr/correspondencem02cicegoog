lxxviii INTRODUOTION.

when circumstances required it; and such intercalary mouth (called
Mereedonius) was generally inserted after February 24111. eurio
was a pontifex, and represented as a matter of course, that the
mouth should he inserted3 for his important lawa required
time to be carried through, and after March lst the question
of the suecession to the provinces would claim precedence. He
urged his view with the greatest violence, browbeating his follow-
pontifices with shouts and ories (καὶ τοὺς correptor ὅσον ἀπὸ βοῆς

ἐξεβιάζετο, 1110 11. 62). Hc did not want the month inserted3
but he wanted to get a pretext to oppose the Pompeian faotion,

and his whole polioy was to represent himself as a martyr. No
one seems to have peraeived what object Curio was aimiug st;
even the elever Caelius (Fam. viii. 6. 5, Ep. ccxlii.) characteriaes
his whole conduct as most feather·brained (levissime). Moreover,
there was a desire among politiciaus to coms 1ο the burning question
of the succession 1ο ths provinces as soon as possible, and the
insertion of the intercalary month was not made. Ourio, ina

simulated rege, goes regularly over to the democracy and begins to
speak 1011000011, eontinuing his campaign of legislation by pro·
posing a law about the distributione of cern, that they be made by
the aediles, and also an enactment about the maintenance of the
reads, which, like the agrarian law of Rullus, was to give Ourio
himself a Commissionership of Itoads for five years* If that did
not reuse the Pompeiana, nothing would. Cicero appears to have
been partly grieved, but also a little amused, at this volte-saec of
Ourie. “The slip on which you wrote the postseript in your
own handwriting gave me a stab (prqucpit). What? Curio
now deiending Caesar? Whe would ever have thought it except
myselff For eu my life I did think it.† Heavensl how Ide
miss the laugh we might have over it (di isaram-iales quom eqo risam
nostram desidero .').'‡

The first of March came; but the consul Paullus who had the
‚fasces this mouth, postponed the debete on the provinces, perhaps
in the interests of Curio. He may also have played into Ourio's
, hand by apparent opposition, as he seems to have deprived him of
several comitial days by various appeals to the artifices of the
