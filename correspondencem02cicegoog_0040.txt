not to assume the offensive, not to croee the Euphrates, but to take
up hie position in some strong place, and watch the movements 01
the enemy. Cassius, whose name ie generally linked with Brutus
as a kind of 1011 10 1111111111, 01 at beet as but a humble admiror 01
virtues quito unattainable by himself, seems to have been about
the most respectable of those blustering impostore who strut across
the stage in the laet scene 01 Romo’e Republie. Though Brutus
taunte him with his ‘itching palm‚' he was a model 01 uprightneee
compared with hie censor, and at the crisis of the threatened
Parthian attach he saved hie country from the possible recurrente
ν 01 the disaster 01 Carrhae. Cicero beare witness to this, though
he characteristieallyaecribes most of the credit to himself: ‘When

my approach got wind, Cassius took heart and the Parthians were
panio-strichen. They fell beck from the town (Antiooh). Cassius
followed them and aohiaved a success. In tho flight Osaoee,

a leading Parthian chieftain‚ received a wound 01 which he died a
few days alter. My name carries great weight in Syria! ⁴* Ha
acknowledgee, in a letter to Cassius himself,† that tha latter had
really gained an important victory. Yet, writiug to Atticus,‡ he
characteriaes as impudent tho letter in which Caesius claime to
have foiled the Parthian attack. In tho same humour Oicero
ridiculas the attempt 01 Bibulus to secure a triumph by rivalling
his own exploit on Mount Amanus, and says that ‘he ie lookiug
for his haye in a laurel·oake.’§ But he is well avare that hie own
aohievemonts will hardly fill the trump 01 fame. When he an·

plagae, you will say, are the Pindenissitae? I never heard of
them before. That is not my fault. Oould I tranefcrm Oilicia
into an Aetolia or Macedonial' For this success he wne saluted
Imperator by the soldiers on the field of battle, and afterwards the
Senate voted a supplication in his honour. He would probably
have gained a triumph but for the ungenerous opposition 01 Cato,
who, however, supported the much inferior claime 01 his son-iu-law
Bibulus to a similar honour. Cicero undoubtedly ehowed con-
siderable military ability. He found himself confronted, immo-
diately on entering his province, withthe threatened invasion from ,
