epooh of history leads Mommsen tc compare the Roman State in

Asia to the Holy Roman Empire of the German nation, had
plotted with Athenais, the mother of Ariobarzanes, to dspose
him and place his brother Ariarathes on the throne. Ariobarzanes
came to Cicero at Cybistra, and detailed to him with tears the
whole plot, which his brother Ariarathes had disclosed to him
with a high-mindedness very rare, especially among Orientale.
Cicero at once took on himself the sole conduct of the affair. He
brought back the faithful ministare of the Kiug, Matres and
Athenaeus, who had been dismissed through the machinatione of
Atheneis and Archelaus, and persuaded the latter to abendon his
ambitione projecta.

‘To me,' he writes, to Atticus, ‘Ariobarzanes owes his throne,
his very lif .’* Yet his publio despatches breathe a spirit of
· complete sslf-effaoement. He has nothing to say about a trane·
action as least as creditable to him aa the exploit of his consulship.
Perhaps he did not wish to advertise too much his suppression of
Archelaus, who was a creature of Magnus. More probably he
knew that such was the state of public opinion in Rome that a
proconsul who sought to do good would not be wisa to let his light
shine before men. It was only to Atticus he could venture to
confide a fact which would have been received by an Appius with
incredulity or indignation.

The whole history of Cicero's proconsulate is the history ofa
struggle between his conscience and his desire to meet the views of
everybody, especially the publicans and the great men at Rome.
Struggles often cause a displaoement of convenient drapery, and so
we find that the curtain, which hid the doings of the magnates of
this period, is sometimes for a moment pushed aeide, and affords a
glimpse of what is going on behind it. Amost amusing letter,
when one reads between the lines, is one† in which Cicero begs
his friend Thermus, pro-praetor of Bithynia, to interest himself
in the business concerns of Cluvius of Puteoli. These concerno are
on a very extensive scale. Whole communities are in his debt,
and hings have well-nigh mortgaged their crowns to him. th
is this mammoth tinancier, of whom, however, history has so very
little to say? The answer to this question slips cut in the last
