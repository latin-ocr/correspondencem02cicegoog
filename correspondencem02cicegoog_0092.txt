sure to rejeot any terme he offered short of eomplete surrender,
and the probability was that in the long run they would aarry the

terme being agreed to (which was just within the extreme bounds of
possibility), be knew now that his supporters in the oity and, to
judge from reoent votes, even in the Senate, were sufficiently
numerous to enable him to faoe whatever assaults the extremists
made upon him with reasonable hopes of being able to withstand
them. Aooordingly, aetuated by these consideratione, early in
