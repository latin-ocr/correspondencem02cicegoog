oii · INTRODUOTION

antiquarium puto ut (laelium ex ea parte landet qua antiquus ast?
We must confess that in a large measure these stricturas seem
just.

When we consider the small packet of letters by (laelius which
we possess, wo must own that he does use a considerable number of
rare words, ag. l. 4, snanrr·atorea; 1. 5, subrostrani ; 5. 3, incili ,⁰
6. 3, conplaciare; 6. 4, cohoriicnla, anscarius (‘a water-commissiouer')‚
ceier·nna; 8. 1, invocatus (‘unaslred': only occurs once in Cicero,
viz. N. D. i. 108) 3 9. 4, columnaria· 9. 5, contricione ; 10. 2, οοὶιβεανί
(‘ to give a lift to’); 15. 1, nnpnn.

All the above the author of the Dialoyue on Oratore would

doubtless characteriae as sordes verborum, to which we may
add the following :-

1. 4, aspiciare, ‘to be thrashed' (of an army).

l. 5, qriod illenim capiti sit .· op. Ter. Phorm. iii. 2. 6, which is
a quite unOioeronian use of the leontinis finalia: the only ex·
ample in Oio. and Caes. is tendere munna alanni.

3. 2, coenredum eins fidem, ‘as far as his honesty is concerned.'

4. 3, ntea comitia opinionem incredibilem nacta aaron = ‘an extra·

ordinary expression oi opinion has been delivered as regards my
election'

6. 3, feruentiaainrc consecrarius, wherein Caelius no mors thought
of tho metaphor in fera-naiian'nre than the low-class Londoner does
in his favourite ‘blooming’ (Caelius appears to affect the word
securiter, op. 8. 2).

8. 9, Ponnreio enni Caesare esse recentium, ‘something (i. e. a
quarrel) is going on between Caesar and Pompeius’

Cinam donarem indii (9. 1), ‘he is playing the good citizen ἐ though
Schmalz (Antibarbarus, ii. 36) says it means that his action is a
perfect parody of the good citizen (the ordinary word is apere .·
op. 17. l, inirifienm ciuem aych).

14. l, relinquant = aron: op. Donatus on Ter. Andr. ii. 4. 7,
rritnqnnm plus habet negationis quam non, and Schmalz, ii.‚ p.
161.

ibid. invb'cnnn in boran ape est = ‘there are good hopes about the
result of the trial!

lo. 2, discupio, ‘bo be bursting’ to do a thing (op. Plaut. Trin.
