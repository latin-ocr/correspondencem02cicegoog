Spero te celeriter et de nobis quod sperasti et de illo quod vix
sperare ausus es auditurum. 4. De re publiea iam novi quidquam
exspectare desistamus, sed cum meatus habitas esset ad Apollinis
a. d. ru. Kalend. Sext. et referretur de stipendio Gn. Pompeii,
mentio facta est de legione ea, quam expensam tulit O. Caesari
Pompeius, que numero esset, quo appeteretur. ttlum Pompeius
‘esse in Gallia’, coactus est dicere Pompeius ‘se legionem abdue·
turum,’ sednon statim sub mentionem et convicium obtrectatorum:
inde interrogatus de successione O. Caesaris, de qua, hoo est, de
provinciis, placitum est ut quamprimum ad urbem reverteretur

On. Pompeius, ut coram eo de successione provinciarum ageretur.
Nam Ariminum ad exercitum Pompeius erat iturus, et statim iit.
Puto Idib. Sextil. de ea re actum iri. Profecto aut transigetur
aliquid aut turpiter intercedetur. Nam in disputando coniecit

illam vocem Cn. Pompeius, ‘omnes oportere senatui dieto audi·

shouts. Boot (Otr. erte, p. 16) thinks
we should read maqui clamores intertui
areret. Perhaps erupere elamore insectatio
irascente est. [assecutio dees not appear tc
bc used by Cicero, but it is found in Dee.
Brutus (Fam. xi. 1, 2).

4. de stipendio Cn. Pornper'p'l] about the

pay for Pompeius’e forces. hese he had
partly in Spain, partly at Ariminum.

expensura tulit] ‘lent’: ep. Liv. vi.
20, 6, tortines produxisse dieitur petibus
siue foenere repenses pecunias tulisset.

quo uuruero esset, quo appeteretur] ‘in
whose contingent it was, and what rt was
being wanted for.’ Cp. Hirt. B. G. viii.
54, 2, Nam Ore. Pourper'us legionem primaru
quarn ud thecaureru rru'seret, confectum et·
delectu proriueiee Coe-suris, euru touqueuu
ee suo uuruero dedit. As to quo appeteretur,
wo hare retained it, the uss reading, as
it seems to suit best with the answcr
of Pompeius. Ernesti thinks that quood
peteretur means ‘fer what purpose it had
been asked for,’ but this would require
tho pluperfcct. Rather we should render,
‘how long it was wanted for! Boot (p.
17) approves cf Lambinus’s reading, et
quondo repeteretur.

†Cum . . . obtrectatorum] Leave out
the second Pompeius and the sentence
will have a certain shape. ‘ When Porn-
pcius said that “it was in Gaul,'’ hc was
compellcd to say that he would take baek
the legion, but not till sometime aiter the
question had been mooted, and his eppo·

nente had taunted him! Pompeius did
not want to say anything definite: he
said at first that the legion was in Gaul,
which was au evasire answer to the
question. Accordingly his opponente
tauntcd him with his irresolution. Ulti-
mately hc did say that he would get
back tho legion, but not till he had been
forced to do so by the outcry of his
opponente. His opponente in this ease
were probably, as Manutius aa s, the
extremo section of the senato' party.
The whole proceeding gare Caelius the
impression of want of straightiorwardness
on l‘ompcius’a port.

inde iuterrogatus] -Therc isne need te
addest: ep. Fam. viii. 8, 3, Ep. ccxxiii,
and t bbelow. Becher (p. 19) adds Tac.
Ann. i. 8; ii. 60; vi. 38.

lroe est de proterariis] Some edd, ap.
Ernesti and Baiter, bracket these words.

placetum est] ‘the opinion arrived at
was' For placitum est, Becher compares
D. Brutus, Fam. xi. l, 2, 6. Pompeius
ia Act. viii. 12, A. 4, Cic. Rep. i. 18.

ad sertem] The temple of Apollo, where
the senate was often held, aa it was on this
occasion, was in tho Prata Flaminia out-
side the walls. The templo of Bellona
was the other sanctuary outside the walls,
in which sittings oi tho senate were held.

eorum] strangcly prep.; see on Ep. cxv.

uret turpiter iretereedetur. Num] ‘or
there will bc a scandalous obstructron by
veto: seandalous beeauss,' dc.
