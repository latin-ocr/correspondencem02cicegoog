xxxiv > INTRODUOTION.

1 had any commanda, aud in lact ahowed undisgniaed diseomtesy 16 me. What
would you think 61 me ii 1 kept auch a follow on my staff? Waa I, who never
brooked insolence from the highest, to endure it 116111 6 benger-on like thia?
Well, tbis Gavius, saeing me again when he was aettiug out 161· Rome, aslued
me in a tone which 1 should 1161 have ventured to uae to a Culleolue: ‘⁸ To
whom am I 16 look sor my allowaneee i” Ireplied, with less asperity than
the circumstances justified in the opinion of the byatanders, ‘⁴ I am aot in the
babit os mukiap uilowunece to ibose coboea aere-icae I do 661 require.'' He went
away in a rage.' Cicero adda, ‘Il the complaints of the soouudrel have any
effect on Brutus, I give him up. In your admiration for him you will have no
rival in me!

But a certain inconsistency in the conduct 61 Oioero shows
itself in these letters. He constantly expresses dismtislaction with

insuda 61 his who send out to him needy adventurers and politioal
or lorensic failures to make a fortune in his province, yet this was
the very thing which he himself did in the case 61 Trebatius. He
strongly recommended him to Caesar, and did 1161 66116661 that 116
hoped Trebatius would enrioh himself in Gaul. We have already
seen him defending, eo far as he could, 1116 provinciale from the
rapacity 61 the publicans3 yet we find him writing to Crassipes,
quaestor 61 bithynia: recommending 16 him the interests 611116
Bithynian Gompany, and oounselling all those aots 61 favouritism
to the publicans which were habitual with Roman governora, but
which were avoided and condemned by himself in his own person
and his own province.

The military ability displayed by Oioero in his proconsulatu
was very considerable. Indeed, both as a poet and as a general
Oioero had lar higher aptitudes than he is generally aceredited
with. 01 oourse we meet in the letters desoribing his campaign
that quality which 116 oandidly ascribes to himself in aletter to
Attious‚† ‘that little strain 61 vanity aud touch 61 elicuciniam
which ie in my character‚’ adding, ‘’tis well not to shut one’s eyes
to one's own foibles.' He underrates the aohievement 61 Cassius,
who really averted 1116 Parthian invasion which Cicero appre-
hended. Cassius had laced the Parthian before. He had taken
part in the fatal day 61 Carrhae-a disaster which might have been
averted is Crassus had adopted the prudent oounsel 61 his quaestor,
