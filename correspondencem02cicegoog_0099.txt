xciv INTRODUOTION.

pelled to fly in slaves' clothing. Cicero says 00 11010000 1100 used
towards the tribunes at all (Fam. xvi. ll. 2, nulla 01 aepulari) ; but
Caesar may have ohosen 10 take this unseemly flight, to which the
. tribunes pretended they had been forced, as cns 01 his many ‘pre-
.’ texts,’ and indeed considerable importunae appears 10 have been
⁵ attached to it at the time: Plutarch, however, puts the matter

in its proper light in his Life 01 Antonius (c. 6).

‘For Gaius Cacsar was not such a light 001000(11χ1111)00100 easily
moved by passion 11010 his calculated plane, that, unless hc had long since
determined 10110 this, he would thus all 01 0 sudden bear arms against his
country because he saw Antonius and Cassius making their escape in a
hired chariat to him. But he had been 101 along time wanting an excuse
(προφάσεως), and these things gave him a specicus pretext and 100000101
the war (σχῆμα rat λόγον εὐπρεπῆ 1011011000). The motivas which impellod
him to wege war 00 011 mankind were those which impelled Alexander
formerly and Cyrus long ago, an uncontrollable (ἀπαρηγόρητος) 1010 of
empire, and 01100110 (περιμανὴς) desire tc be first aad greatest, which 110
could not attain unless Pompeius were put down.'

There is 0 great deal in all this. Caesar 111111 long ago formed
his plens, and 111111 with hie consummate intellect 10100000 the
course 01 010010; he rear no light person easily swayed by passion,
and he 11011 0 fixed determination to bs the first 1000 10 the State.
It was well for humanity that he became sc: the century 01 the
Senatorial domination had been one 01 the 110101 ages 101 the world
which it ever endurcd, the period 01 ths early Empire was one
01 1110 best which it 0101 enjcyed.* But in regarding the benefita
which flowed to mankind from Caesar’s victory, and in cur
admiration 01 the abthy and coolness with which hc not merely
affected the conquest 01 Gaul and the destruction 01 the wichad
oligarchy at Rome, but laid the foundation 01 the Roman Empirc,†
