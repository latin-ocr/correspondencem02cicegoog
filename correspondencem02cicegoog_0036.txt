loss-of the aooounts in re King Ptolemy, holds the positiones

moral oensor and general referes in matters oi moral and peouniary
fflotlllldlhll know how strong was the republican spirit in the noble
Brutus. We read that he

‘would have brooh'd
The eternal davil to keep state in Rome
Aa easily aa a king)

But withan Asiatie Majeety he was not above doing a little
business, if a few milliens of seateroes were to be turned honeetly
-or otherwise. We find him inoessantly plying Oioero with
solioitatione to squeeze out oi the wretohed Ariobarzanes moneys
whioh the King owed him. Even Pompeius shewed meroy. He
aoeepted thirty-three Attio talenta a mouth, and this ‘did not
make up the amount of the monthly interest! But Pompeius
isoontent with this instalment of the interest, and is satieded to
forego the oapitnl. Not so the noble Brutus. His importunities
are so wearying that Oieero thinks of giving up all attempta to
protect the King or manage his affairs. Attious, however, per·
suaded him to maintain his guardianship. Cioero auooeeded at last
in getting hom the King 100 talenta for Brutus, who ‘haareaovered
more money than Pompeius, in proportion to the amount of his
loan.' Yet Brutus does not oease to write disoourteous letters
olamouring for more. Verily,

‘ His life was gentle, and the elementa
So mix’d in him that nature might stand up
And say to all tha world, Thia was a mon! ’

Oharaoters given by biographers have often to be read, like
enoomiums on tombstones, with considerable deduotions; but
tradition is rarely eo perverted ae actually to reverse the oharaoter
of her favourites; Medea may be made too heroe, or Ino not
suffieiently temful, but rarely are the oharaeters aotually inter·
changed.

Tharais, however, one anoient testimony about the eharaoter
of Brutus whioh is worth all the rest Caesar, that unerring judge
