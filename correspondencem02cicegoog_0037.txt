of character, has pronounced upon him, and his verdiot is, ‘When
he wants a thing, he wants it in earnest.’ ⁸ This, be it observed,
isthe only contemporary, or ancient, judgment 01 the character
01 Brutus which is consistent with the picture 01 him presented by
the letters 01 Cicero. His untiring anergy in ooeroing the Sala·
minians, and his pertinacity in olamouring 10111010 remittanoes
from Ariobarzanes, show that he was not disposed to give up an
attempt in which he 0100 embarked. The words 01 000001 would
not be inapplicable 10 0 Shylook. When we read that Brutus, on
the point of death, bewailed 11 some verses from Euripides his
late discovery, that virtue was but a name, Ι1111110110 had pursued
itas areality (ἔργον), we cannot but think of another meaning of the
word ἔργον, the interest 01 profit on money, and reflect how well
he would have deserved the panegyrice of his admirere, if he had
followed virtue with half the energy which he devoted to the
pursuit 01 pecuniary profit.†

When wa see that 0010 and Brutus, those heavy fathers in the
drama of the decline of the Roman Republic, are so little alive to
the duties 01 0 civilized administration, we are 101 surprised 10 find
a y'eene premier like (laelius taking slight view of the position of a ,

(laelius writes to him begging him, as 01 course be 1100 now
nothing 10 do, to devote his leisure 10 the composition 01 some
work 10 be dedicated to himself, so that the 10110 01 (laelius may
be linked with the literery fame cf hisdistinguished friend. The
period of his proconsular government is just the time for this, as
he has now nothing else 10 oocupy his leisure. The sole governor
of a province 101 larger 11101 Ireland must 1001 grateful for any
employment which will beguile the vacant hours 01 his pro·
consulate. We afterwards read how (laelius wanted 010010 10
0100010 him some panthere from Cibyra, 101 the show which he was
about to give as Aedile; and he seems offended because Cicero,
while promising 10 engage the services 01 the regular professional
