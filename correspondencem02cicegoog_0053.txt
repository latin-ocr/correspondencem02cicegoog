xlviii INTRODUOTION.

everything that bitter hate and malignant respectability could
say 6111161 against her was accepted by Cicero as but the truth:
she murdered her husband, and her whole 1116 showed her tc be ci
tho most unexampled and audacious profligaoy.· Then 116 puts
forward the ‘wild-oats' theory, and indeed with as much judgment
and good sense 66 11 can ever be put.† Caelius, 11616616, went
to live near hor in her brother's house; many excellent citizens

yet in that dangerous period of life when it 16 66 easy to fall; but
suoh an orator as Caelius must have been a devoted student of bis

and cannot have dellied long in enervating indulgencc; he did
perhaps pause for a moment, and his resolution 1116116 down 61 that
turning point in 1116 1666 61. lile, but it was only for a moment3
and we must remember that Clodia is the lady-friend 61 overyone;
and 66 66, and 66 on.‡ Thon thero are amusing touches. The learned
oounsel say that Caelius isreoklessly extravagant, for he paid
thirty thousand sesterces as rent 1611116 house hc 1661111616 Clodius.
‘Hc really only paid ten thousand ; butI understand Clodius wants
