52. MARCUS CAELIUS RUFUS. lv

was a matter which, oven as early 00 February, appears to have
begun to seriously vex the soul 01 the deeply-involved (laelius.

In April he went with Caesar to Spain, but we do not hear
anything of him during the campaign. Before he went, he had,
at ansar’s orders, written a most urgent letter to Cicero, begging
him not to leave Italy and join the Pompeian oamp, but to romain
neutral (Fam. viii. 16). He implores Oioero, 11 101 101 his own
01 least for his son's sake, to be oautious, not to heed the upbraid·
inge of the optimates or the insufforablearroganoe 01 some of the
Caesariana (this, no doubt, Caelius himself felt most bitterly)‚ but
to go into 001110 small town, remote from the war, and remain thero
10111101 till all should be over, or at least till the 0010100101 01 1110
war in Spain. He tells him that Caesar has beoome savage 01
the ooutinued opposition he has met with, and expresses as his
opinion that ‘to aot against Caesar now that he is viotorious,
while you were unwilling to injure him when his 1011111100 11010
uncertain, and to join with those in their flight whom you would
not follow in their stand—this is the height of folly.’* The

reply (Fam. ii. 16) 010 1111001110 01 1110 different oharaoters of
the writer and his oorrespondent. Cioero will be oautious, and do
nothing to lessen the good will whioh Caesar feels towards him ; he
is sorry that (laelius should have so poor 011 opinion 01 his prudenoe,
but, by the despair he feels eaoh day, his beart has grown 00110110,
and he is now past feeling sorrow 01 anything. ‘As 10 my son,
and I am glad you are interested in him, if any remnant of 1110
free state survive, I shall leave him a sufficient heritage in the
memory of my name; but if not, his lot will be nothing different
from that 01 the rest of his fellow·oitizeus.’†

But we 010 11010 001 00 mueh oonoerned with Oioero’s toneb-
ing reply 00 with the very low view (laelius takes of the oonrse
one should adopt in politioal orises: 00 he had said before, ‘As
long 00 1110 struggle is oarried on in a eonstitutional manner
you should be on the more honourable side; when it oomes to
