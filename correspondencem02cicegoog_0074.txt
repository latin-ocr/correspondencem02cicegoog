planted in that looality were to have the same rights as Transpa-
danos. There was some doubt at the time whether the man who
was soourged had held a magistraoy or not: but whether or
1101, says Oieero (Att. v. 10. 2, Ep. oe), 110 was a Transpadana,
meaning probably that the Transpadanos should not be ueedlessly
insulted.¹'

On the first 01 June Maroallus, when 110 got the fascea again,

wished to bring forward onae more the question 011110 Galliepro·
vinees3 but it appears to have been represented to him by members

01 his own party that there was no need 101 haste, aud that they ’

should not show their hands 100 soon; ‘itis not from laainess,'
writes (laelius (Fam. viii. 2. 2, Ep. oxori.), ‘but 110111 polioy‚ as Ι
think, 11101Μο10011110’ attaeks have subsided.’' 011 the 22111101

every ono should obsy the Senate, and this oraoular uttsranoe was
oonsidered 10 be, and perhaps was, significant. 00011110 thought
that 1110 matter would be settled on the 13111 01 August, 11 there
was not a soandalous interventiou ou the part 01 the tribunes
(Fam. viii. 4. 4, Ep. aovi.) ‘But the thing Ι am really lookiug
forward to,' says Caelius, ‘is to 000 Paullus, the musal-oleat, who
will have to speak first, stating his view 01110010011011.’ For
there was something more than suspiaiou that the buildar 01 the
Basilius Aemilia, end, perhaps, joint-builder with Caesar ottho
Basilioa dulia, had been aided in 111000 popular works by Gallio
