51. OIOERO'S PROVINCIAL OOVERNMENY. xix

1001 arriving, 011 with him Volusius and the quaestor Meseinius
110110. Aooompanied by these, Oieere left Athens on J uly 7th,
aud, touohing at Ceos, Gyaros, Syros, and Delos, lauded at last at
Ephesus 01 J uly 20111, ‘560 days after the battle 01 Bovillae.’*

So eompletely 10 his thoughts run on Rome and her things, that
he dates his landing in Asia 11011 the seuffle on the Appian Way‚
in whiah Clodius lost his life. ‘N0w,' he writes te Attious,† ‘now
010 011 10 the test the theories 01 0011101 which I have 00 long
paraded.' This rafleetion (which does not seem to have oeourred
10 him again) was forced on him hy the enthusiastio 100001101
given him at Ephesus, whioh was the more gratifying beoause
Ephesus formed no 0011 01 his provinoe. It was 101 their governor
whom they weloomed, but the man 01 101-101101 learning, integrity,
and eloquenee, the proseoutor 01 Verres, and the Father 01 his
Country. But not even this tribute oeuld make Gioero remember,
10111010 than a few minutos 010 time, that thare was a world
outside Rome. In the same letter he writes: ‘Pray give me a
full and most aoourate aeeount 01 averything thetis happeniug at
Roma, or is about to hoppen—and espaoielly the news 01 the law
0001103 However, the plaudite 01 Asia evoked 11011 him 11 the
same letter 0 promise whioh may be oalled the watohword 01 his
administration. ‘I shall oarry out the principles 01 your Sehool
jor Gooernora, and I shall be all things 10 all men.'‡

Here we have the souroe 01 all the integrity and exeellanee 01
Oioero's 01110111 lile, and beside it the reason 011110 0011111011110
10 10100 the standard 01 provincial government. From undue
aelf-aggrandisement—not 10 mention the extortions 011 011011100
habitually praetised by Roman governors—he was withheld, not
only hythe 01000010 01 Atticus, hut by his own gentle and ele·
vated nature. These led him 10 0010111 the interests 01 the pro·
vinee in every way, so far as they eould be influenaed hy his own
oonduot and the behaviour 01 his staff. But there was something
mora important still than the well-being 01 the provinces. This
was the ordinum 0000011110, whioh 10 still his oabala and talisman.
'Phese two aims often did not eoineide—indeed, they were 01101 11
111001 00111101. And when they did oonfliet, this best 01 0100010110
shewed himself only 100 ready 10 00011100 the 01011100. When
