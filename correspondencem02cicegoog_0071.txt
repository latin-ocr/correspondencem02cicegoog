and other displeys in honour ol his daughter J ulia3 gained the
favour oi many petty kings and the more important municipalities
by lavish expenditurc of hie Gallie gold; and, according to his old
cherished plan of extending the citizenship, made amore extensive

Pompeius passed another law in 702 (52), that candidates for

any magistracy should tender their nemesin persen, a practice
vvhich had been required previously, but hed fallen into dmuse.

This lew must have been postedupfor strictitudinem, and yet it

appears tc have been passed without any protest from ansar's
party, which at this time was led by the tribune Gaius Vibius

Pansa. The law cf the Ten Tribunos had so explicitly granted
Caesar the privilege, and personat attendance was suoha mere pieoe
ot formality,§ that probably they thought that the new law would,
as amatter oi course, not be in any way used to Gaasar's dis-

† Caesar appears to hare treawd the Transpadanes as tull citizens, while it would
seem that in striet legality they had only Latin rights: see aa excellent neta in

⁴ Mommsen, B. H. iv. 312, where hc urges that only on the supposition that Caesar was
trcating the Transpadana towns ae possessed of tull citizenship could the repert hare
arisen that they were ordered by Caesar to elect quattuorviri (ece notes to Ep. clxxxv.
2). ‘This hypothesis too explains why Hirtius designatos the Transpadana towns as
‘colonias of Roman burgesees’ (B. θ. viii. 24) ; and why Caesar aaron the colony of
Comum, founded by him, aa a burgetor-colony (Suet. Gaea. 28, Strabo, v. 1. p. 213,
Plutarch Uace. 29) ; while the moderata party oi the arietocrecy conceded to it only the
same rights as to the other Transpadana colonica, viz. Latin rights; and the viltras even
declared the cisio rights conferred on the settlers as altogether null, end consequently
did not concede to the Comenses the privileges attached to the holding oi aLatin
municipal magistraey: see Cic. A tt. v. ll. 2, Ep. ec. Appian, B. 0. ii. 26.’

§Marius and Lucullus had been elected to the consulship in their absence, and
Cicero, too, in a speech delivered during his consulship, says (De lege Agr. ii. 24) that
candidates ior magistracies need not appear in person. Yet three years later ool (60)
