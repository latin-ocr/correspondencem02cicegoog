ADDENDA ΤΟ THE COMMENTARY. 299

maen ιο audiences oi foreign embassies3 and accordingly ιιι Lex Pupia did not hold
ior that mouth. Bardt (in Hermes, vii. 27) is oi opinion that the Lex Pupia forbadethe
Senatetobe held on those dies comitiales on which comitia were actually held. Willems
(Le Simat, ii. lot, note 6) objecta that no such restrictionis ever mentioned: in all tha
passages in which the law isalluded ιο there is implied an absolute incompatibility
between the comitial days and sittings oi ιιι Senate. Further, he argues that
it ιιι views oi Lange or Bardt were correct, ιιι Sanatrss consultum in Cic. Fam. viii.
8, ὁ, Ep. ccxxiii„ setique eius rei causa per dies comitiales senatum laborent senatusque
marottam jacerent should rather be ese per dies comitiales mem populo ageretur. Willems
supposes ιιι Lex Pupia specified certain comitisl days on which the Senate could not
behold, and that ic required special exemption ii a meeiing was convened on ono oi
those days. He then goes on to establish empirically some oi the dies comitiales on
which the Senate could not meet, aa. iit, and prid. Non. Jan. (Caes. nen. Ciw. i. ι,
i), from xv. Kal. Febr. to prid. Kal. Febr. (Cic. Fam. i. 4, 1, Ep. xcviii), certain
dies comitiales in March (ii. viii. 8, ι, Ep. ccxxiii), &c.; and he supposes that by
implicatior on all other comitial days than those actually specified in the law the Senate
could be held, as it is found to have been held on the following comitia] days amongst
others: prid. Kal. Mart. (Ancon, p. 44, Or), xi. Kal. Sext. (Cic. Fam. viii. 4, 4, Ep.
cowll, iii Id. Sext. (decom, p. 47) prid. Kal. Oct. (Cic. Fam. viii. 8, ι, Ep. ccxxiii).
The objection ιο this theory is that which holds against most empirical theorica, vir.
that tha evidence is not sufficient to prove any leading principle, aud wc surely must
suppose some leading principle in the law: cp. Herzog„ op. cit, p. 910.

On the whole, the view oi lange is most satisfactory. Mommsen (St. R. iii. 922)
virtually agrees, noticing some exceptione to the main feature oi the law that the
donate could not be held on comitial days, ria-(1) that sometimes a sitting of the
donate was held on a day, marked indeed comitial in the Calendar (e. y. vii. Id. lau·
765 (49), Caes. Bell. eis. i. ι, 4), but which may have lost its character as comitial by
being a maritet day or a day on which an extraordinary festival was appointed to be held;
(2) that the Senate could pass a special resolution in certain crisos not only ιο sit
during comitinl days, aa. Cic. Fam. viii. 8, ι, Ep. ccxxiii. [and it isthus that
Mommsen explains the great number oi sittings during the Catilinasian crisis]; but also
ιο forbid the Comitia ιο ιι held on comitial days: cp. Cic. Mur. 51, resaisistis fieri
umatus coasultum referente mc, mc postero dic consitio laberentur, ut dc isis robus s'n semaia
aym possemus. But thero is no necessity to assume this last exception, unless we
place the enactment of the Lex Pupia prior to 691 (63 n. c).

There is ιιι utmoet variety of opinion about the date oi the law. Mommsen (op.
cit, p. 923) places it as early as about 600 (164 n. c), basing his view on the fact that
ir can hardly bs accidental that the four dates oi sittings oi the Senate which we know
ot between 613 and 669 (141 and 91 mo.) are allon non-comitial days. But till ιιι
leat hali-century oi ιιι republic it was probably customary to hold ιιι Senate on ιιι
non-comitial days. We incline to think that ιιι Lex Pupia was a consular law ol 68³
(ol n. ο.), one of the consuls ior that year being M. Pupius Piso Calpurnianus. Τιι

law is first mentioned in 698 (66 n. e), cto. Fam. i. i, 1, Ep. xcviii. ; and ιιι great
number of sittings oi the Senate held on dies comitiales in 691 (69 n. c.)—wahsre
evidence oi no less then six between ir. Kal. Oct. and prid. Non. Dec. : see willens,
op. cit. ii. lto, note 6—seems to point to ιιι conclusion that ιιι law bad not been
ouacted at that time. Lange (op. cit. 191) asdgns the Lex Pupia to 683 (ll n. c.)
--M. Pupius Piso Calpurnianus having been praetor about that year-before ιιι Lex
Gabinia oi 687 (67). Butthisisbynomeansrendered certainby (lic. Q. Fr. ii. 11 (18), 8,
