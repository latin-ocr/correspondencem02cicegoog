§2- MAROUS CAELI US RUFUS. xli
Ι1693(61)01111111 went witi Q. Pompeius Rufus, the pro·

consul, as one of his comites* to Africa. It was the custcm ior
young men 11 distinction to accompany provincial governors in
this semi-official way, so that they might see something 11 the
world, and become acquainted with the manner in vvhich the
provinces vere administered; thus Catullus was a conver of
0. Memmius in Bithynia. Caelius went tc Africa rather than
1ο any other province because his father hed large property there,
and he could take that opportunity 11 loching alter it. 11 we are
tc believe Cicero (0111. 73), hs von the high opinion of Pompeius;
and we may believe him, for Caelius is always spoken 11 by the

ancient writers with a certain affection, and sc must have had .

something liheable at all events if not loveabls in his nature.
When anlius returned from Africa his education was con-

sidered complete, and he had to enter cn public life. There was
only one vvay to dc that, nemely, by bringing an action against rome-

cne. That was the recognized course, justas with us it is (11 used
. to be) to gain a seat in Parliament. Iu 695 (59111111 age 11 about

twenty-six,† he accused Gaius Antonius, who bad been colleague
1101111111 the consulship in 691 (63). Antonius had lately re·
turned from misgoverning Macedonia, and Caelius accused him ot
having men implicated in the Catilinarian conspiracy, and 11
maiestas. As regards the former charge, Antonius, as we know
from Sallust (011. 59. 4), unfortunately, but suspiciously‚ fell lame
just before the decisivo engagement with Catilium and the ground
ol the indictment for 1111111111 was, that after he had sufficiently
robbed the Macedonicus, he had attached some neighbouring pecple„

tha State, and a staunch and trusty friend.⁷ The actual facta 11 the case are set forth
differently in a letter 1ο Atticm (1. 2. 1., Ep. xi). ‘I 111 thinking just nov 11 defend·
ing 01111111 my competitor. We have judges all that wc could wish, and the utmost
good-vill 111111 accuser. Ihcpe 11 he ia acquitted that he will aid nre in my canvaas
sor the consulship3 111111 not, vve shall bear it with resignation! 01111111 was accused
by 0111111111 miaappropriating publio moneys‚ and Cicero had not much belief in hie
innccence: indeed he thought his guilt 11 plain 11 runlight 11 mid-day (Catilina, 11
iudicatum erit meridie non lucere, certus erit competitor, stt. 1. 1. 1, Ep. x.).
