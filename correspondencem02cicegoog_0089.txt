lxxxiv INTRODUOTION.

of Augure, vasated hythe orator Hortensius, who died in May.
The eandidates were L. Domitius Ahenobarbus, and M. Antonius
(son of J ulia, sister of L. Julius Caesar), who had been 01010011]
Caesar as his quaestor}t and in whose eandidaturs Caesar took
suoh a keen interest that he earne back from Northern Gaul to
Upper Italy in order to forward his aanvass. Caesar arrived too
late te lend his aid, but Antonius had, however, been elected
(Bell. Gall. viii. 50). In J uly the electione for Tribunos earne
on. Amongst those ohosen the most important were this 00110
Μ. Antonius, who was a olose personal friend of Ouri03 Quintus

the latter’s own request‚ but was now a vigorous Caesarium and
Gaius Cassius Longinus.† In the same mouth the eleotions for
oonsuls were unfavourable to Caesar: his oandidate, L. Sulpioius
Galba, was defeated, and there were eleoted Gaius Claudius Mar-
esllus, brother of the oonsul 01 703 (51), eousin of the oonsul of
704 (50), and L. Cornelius Lentulus Orus, who had in 703 (51)
been defeated by Dolabella, Gieero's son-in·law‚ for the quindeoem·
virate.‡ Both were on the Senatorial side, but as Lentulus was
deeply in debt, he was not altogether trusted: next year he
appeared as a most violent opponent of Caesar. The praetore, as
usual, throughout the struggle, were men of no deoided party
bias.§

Like a dead sultry afternoon, before a thunder·storm breaks at
nightfall, the whole of August and September dragged through.
There was hardly a movement, exeept when the oensor, Appius
Claudius Puloher, apompeus 1001 like Bibulus, but a patrioian and
an Appius Claudius, began ta strut and fret his hour upon the stage.
