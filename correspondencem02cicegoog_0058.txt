§2- MARCUS CAELI US RUFUS. liii

is certainly most savage when he is refused a loan of money.
Caelius blazed up, and poured out his indignation to Cicero ina
really entertaining letter (Fam. viii. 12. Ep. cclxxix), ‘After Ι
found that he did not think me worth repaying for the services I
had done him, I preferred to bind myself to a man totally dis·
oonneeted with me, and (because I am your friend) not at all
kindly disposed to me, than to have to tolerate the look of that apel’
Appius grew indignant, and once more set the Claudian bull-dog,
Pola Servius, on Caelius, just aa the latter was holding his games
as Curule hedilo. They aocused him of unnatural crimes, which

Caelius promptly answered by aocusing the starched·up Censor
Appius himself on the same charge3 and also by publicly de·
mauding from him the shrine belonging tc the people which he
had appropriated-he, the Censor, who should bave severely
punished snob an appropriation'in the ease of another. Caelius
had decidedly the best of it. This is all amusing enough, and
there is a good deal of elementary human nature displayed3 but

it is especially uoteworthy as showing the violence in anger and at
the samo time promptitudo in action, which were salient features
in Caelins' character.

It ia not very easy to fix the exact time when Caelius began to
think seriously about joining the Caesarians ; but in September, as
we have seen, he was attached by Appius Claudius, the Censor,
and sought the aid of the other Censor, Piso Caesoninus, a
supporter of Caesar. This tended to draw him away from the
Pompeiana. A violent hostility which sprung up between him
and Domitius Ahenobarbus, astronuous anti-Caesarian, must have

strengthened this tendency. When Caelius wrote viii. 14, Ep.
cclxxx. (late in September), we may say his mind was made

up.

⁸ The love-match is going to issue in open war. I don't know whattodo.
Itis Caesar's cause, not his followers, that I detest. Yon ought not to
terget, however, that, in a quaml, as long as matters are conducted oon·
stituticnally without appeal to arms, one should follow the more honour-
atle side (honestiorem partem); when it eomes to a question of war,
the atrcupcr] (firmiorem); tho ‘safer’ then is the ‘better' In the
approaching contest 1 see Pompeius will have the Sancte and the jndges:
all will flock to Caesar, who live either with fear hanging over them or with
no hope of battaring themselves ; as to the army there is no comparison.'
