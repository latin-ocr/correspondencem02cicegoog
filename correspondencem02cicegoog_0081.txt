accuse Metellus Scipio, the iether-inlaw 01 Pompeius. Rostriotion
should be put 00000 expensos 01 havelling, so allegatio 0000000010
de itineribus was promulgated, ameasure which 1011 mainly on the
Senators (ep. Ast. vi. 1. 25, Ep. 00111). Also the land ol Pompeius'
friend, King J uba, should be confiscatod3 but Fata 00010 her irony

somcwhat lengthened account oi this Gaius Memmius. He is to 00 distinguished
from C. Memmius, tr. pl. in 700 (04) who was his nephcw; and from O. Memmius,
who 0001 part in the procoss against Scaurus in the same year (Asson. p. 29),
who was his son by Fausta, Sulla's daughter. The idea that his cognomen
was Gemellus is now quite srploded; it restcd on Fam. xiii. 19. 2, where,
however, both M and 11 read 0. Meuius Gemellus; besides 110010 Memmius
000 possessed 0 cognomen he would have had it on his coins, and 000 (as he has)
the name 01010 tribe (cp. Mommsen Histoire ds la Menaeis rosnains ii. 430 00.
Blaene, 1870). Ηο belonged to 0 plebeias family, 000 was son ol L. Memmius, to
whom Cicero alludcs 00 0 pleadsr but not a first-rate 000 (Brut. 304). During 000 Sar·
toricn wer, both before and during the year 677 (77), G. Memmius servsd as praetor in
Spain (010. Βο10. 0), so he must have 0000 bom before 600 (104). 10689 (66)οο
strenuously opposed the triumph 01 Ι.. Lucullus (Plut. Luc. 37, 000. Min 29); 000
six years later we hear 01 him again in connexion with the Lucullan family as having
sn intriguo with the wife 01 M. Lucullus (Aac. i. 19. 4, Ep. xxia). He appears to
have tried 00 000000 tho young wife 01 Pompeius; hut J ulia was notan ordinary
Roman metron, ior eho lcved her husband dcarly (Suet. De Gmmm. 14: ep. Plut. Pomp.
03). 10 696 (08) Memmius was praetor, 000 during his year 01 office violently attached
Caesar's lawe (Schol. Bob. 297: Suet. Caes. 23: cp. 40). Afterhispraetorshiphe
went ss propraetcrto Bithynia 10 697 (07), and appears to hare had some trifling military
successes, as he is styled rmnsnron on his son's coins (Mommsen op. cit. N 0. 206, p.
014, 0000 2). Catullus was 00001 010 staff, 000 represents him as 0 profligate (irrumc-
tor, Cat. x. 12 ; xxviii. 10) ; 000 we must not 0010 000 literally the random terras 01
00000 which Catullus flings about so lreely. In 700 (04) Memmius was 0000010000
for the consulship and was supported by Caesar (000. iv. 10. 7, Ep. cxliii: 16. 6, Ep.
00110), ciaet which shows how easily politicicns 01 000 000000 ranlr shiited 00000 00
0010 tima ; but he entered into and disoloscd the scandolous compsct about the consular
electione (00010. 17. 2, Ep. calin), and thus lost again the favour 01 caesar (see Introd. 00
Vol. ii, p. xlii). 10 consequence 01 010 0000000 00 this election Memmius was accused in
702 (02) by Q. Acutius (or curtius) 01 bribery (Q. Fr. iii. 2. 3, Ep. 01). Το save
himself he accused oi bribery Metellus Scipio, the father-indam os Pompeius; but as
thelatter assumed mourning garments and sent for the judges and ashed themasa
special favour to aequit Metellus Scipio (Plut. Pomp. 00 Appian ii. 24, val. Max. ix.
0. 3), Memmius gave up the accusation and went into exile into Athens. Eithcr 00 0010
occasion or previously he got possession hy decrec 01 100 areopagus 01 ‘some tumhled
down house or other which belonged 00 Epicurus’ (nescio quid Epicuri parietinarum) in
the dome Melita. Memmius had intended to pull this down and huild 00 the 0100, 000
afterwards gave up the idea. The Society 01 000 Epicumans at Athens, who hada
touching veneratior for their founder and all places associated with him, wished to get
this house from Memmius; 00000 appears to haro refused and 00 havo had some
quarrel in tho matter with Patro, tho then head 01 000 Socicty. When (liceto came to
Athens on his journoy out to Cilicia, hc was csked by Patro tc uso his iufluenco 0100
