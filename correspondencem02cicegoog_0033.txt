· xxviii INTRODUOTION.

Now let us see how Brutus appears in the letters of this
pen{llis paragon of virtue who exolaims in the play,

‘Lot the gods so speed me, as 1 love
The name of honour more than 1 sear death,'

had, as we have seen, aooompanied his unole (lato to Cyprus, and
had himself brought baok the money realized to Rome. But it
appears from the letters ol this time that the young inoorruptible
had not been idle, or intent solely on publio business, while he
sojourned at Cyprus. He had been loohing ont for a profitable
iuvestment, and had suooeeded in seouring oustomers. The people

should appoint him Prefeot ol Cyprus. He expeoted that by
