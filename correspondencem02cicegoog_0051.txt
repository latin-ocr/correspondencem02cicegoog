xlvi INTRODUOTION.

alleged that (laelius had murdered or oeused to ΒΘ murdered some
Alexandrian ambassadors, and had tried to poison clodio. The
proseoution was eertainly instigated by clodianae her brother; it
was led by Atratinus, and baoked by Herennius and Balbus.
Caelius defended himself, and the defense was supported by his
two masters, Crassus and Gioero. Some notioes of the speeoh
whioh Caelius delivered on this oooasion are preserved, and they
are oharaoterietio. ΗΘ was nominally defending himself, but he
really stood out on the offensive. He apologiaed to the judges
ior his violenee of manner and expression. ‘I pray you, judges,
and all oonneoted with thie trial, to pardon me if my look ΒΘ
ever too offensive, my voioe raised too high, or, what is atride,
if my gestures seem too extravagant' ' ΗΘ exeroised his
espeoial gift of giving telling nieknames semein to oleave to those
to whom they were applied. He oalled clodia, as we have seen,
a ‘twopenny-halfpenny Clytaemnestra,’ and one Plotius Gallus,
who was supposed to have written his speeoh for young Atratinus,

he desoribed as a ‘skilly·fed rhetorioian' (rhetorem hordearium).†

⁸ Quintilian, xi. 1. 61. Ne oui vestrum atque etiam omnium, qui ad rem agendam
adsunt meus aut vultus molestior aut vox immoderatior aliqua aut denique, quod mini·
mum (al. nimium) est, iactantior gestus fuisse videatur.

† We do not profess to be very certain as to what this means. Suetonius (Rhet. 2)
explains it by desoribing Gallus as inflatam oo terem oo mdtdom. casaubon supposes
areferenoe to the inferiority of barlay as nourishment to wbeat, in that it puffed out
those who ate it without strengthsning them; and refers to the fact that it was ons of
the punishmants in the Roman army to put a man on Θ diet of barlay instead of wheat.
Gallus would then be a starveling speech-writer, and the above translation perhaps
will be sufficiently abusive. Friedliinder (Sittrnyeechiehtr Rom, iia 355) referring
to this passage would appear to gire to the niekname Θ meaning almost opposed to that
given by Suetonius. ΗΘ says the epithet hordeariae was applied to gladiatore beoauss
they were generally fed ou barley (op. Plin. 11. N. xviii. 72), and so a rhetor hordeariae
would be ‘a gladiator, a bully, oia rhetorieian.’ But vere gladiatore, who requiredan
axoeedingly strong physique, generally fed on barleyf Friedlhnder gives no satisfao·
toryproof that they were; Galen (vi. p. 529, ed. Kuhn) only says that a little barley·
meal was mixed up with their bean-porridgs. Was it not most probably a punish· ’
mantin the gladiatorial aehools also as well as in the army to put refractory member·
on barley instead of giving thern their iuual nourisbing mixture (saginati And if tho
word is a niuknume at all, would not Θ niokname be most naturally applied to those
who were subject to this disgraos? We think it possible that it waa an old namo
(hence the imperfect remeamus in Pliny> for gladiatore, who in early times may have
been fed on barlay, then any sort of creaturas who oould mand up and be knoolred
down would suffiae, uo great strength or skill being required of them till their combats
bsoanm one of the stapla amusements of the Roman people.
