Later in the same letter Caelius says :—

‘If neither go tc the Parthian War, Ι see a great struggle hanging over
us which can only he settled by appealing to the swerd. Both arc ready in
heart and hand. If there were no danger tc you personally, Fortuna
would he preparing for us a splendid and delightful spectacle.’

There can ΒΘ little doubt as to the conclusion which (laelius drew
from these promises: There is sure to be war: in such a case itis
‘best’ to be on the side ol the big battalions: Caesar has the big
battelions: therefore—

When the case of ansar’s claims came to a crisis Caelius and
M. Calidius took up the position that Pompeius should go to his
province Spain, and so cut off all causes for war. Caelius and
Curio were the only two senators who voted against the proposal
ol Scipio, on J anuary lst, 705 (49), that Caesar should he declarod
a public enemy3 and a few days later they fled along with the
tribunes to (laeserat Ravenna*

'I'hough it does not strictly belong to the present volume it
may still be well to mention here the remaining events of anlius’
life. Towards the end ol February, Caesar, to (laelius’ great
dissatisfaction, sent him to Intemelii with a few cohorte to put
down the revolt ol that town. A certain nobilis called Domitius,
who was friendly to Caesar, had been murdered hya slave,
Bellienus, who had been hribed hythe Pompeian lection in the
town, and arms were taken up against the Caesariana. Caelius
writes,† ‘the Domitii are going to ruin, you say, all along the
line. I only wish the son ol Venus (ie. Caesar) had as much
spirit in the case ol your Domitius (the Domitius who was oap-
tured in Corfinium and released by Caesar) as the son of Psecas in
that of this Domitius ’-a bitter saying, and one which shows with
unfortunately too much eleemess that Caelius did not at all approve
ol Gaesar’s clemency. Il he was going to spare, and even treat
with indulgence, enemies in arms, there was every reason to be
apprehensive that at the end ol the war he would not give the
victore the spoils, and perhaps actually not abolish debts. This
