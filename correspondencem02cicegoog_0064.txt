attempted to bribe. Such was the vulgar ending of the attempt
by the issue of whioh Cicero and the Pompeiane were to be com·
pelled to conquer against their will.

The basis of anlius’ character was selfishness' tempered by
passion-passion in the sense of anger, not in the sense of ardour.
He was possessed of great gifts of person and intelleot, he had a
shrewd mind and a shsrp tongue, he was elever at expediente
and prompt in executiug them, he was resolute in whatever he
undertook, and persistent in carrying it through: but he laolsed
entirely anything even approaohing to principle. Thus he could
not conceive how Cicero oould dream of adhering to the losing side
when ha could join the winning one. In his calm momente
when he is purely selfish he is always cynioal, sneering, clover,
no doubt, but rather petty and contemptibl . But his wild 'angry
temper, faulty though such a temper generally is, was the
bright spot in anlius’ nature. Whether as friend or foe, when
he was thoroughly roused he forgot himself, and acted with
that passion and oonoentration which is closely akin to, and may
readily be mistalren for, genereus enthusiasm and honest indigna·
tion. Thus there are none of the sociante, as M. Geston Boissier
notioes,† who do not spesk with a certain affection of Caelius3
they all bave some flowers to cast upon his grave. ‘His eircum-
stanoes were far more limited than his intelligenoe,' says Velleius.
‘He was a man who deserved a sounder mind and a longer life,’

says Quintilianss It is with pity that we also turn from the review
ol his career, from his mis-spent life and dishonourable death, to
