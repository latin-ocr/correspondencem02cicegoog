might bc, and was intended tc be, putto, and raised a clamcur that
it was directed against Caesar. Then Pompeius added an excep·
tion, that cf course it did not apply tc those whom the peopls had
exempted from the obligatior 01 personul attendance-an exception
invalid formally, as inserted by the mere authority 01 Pompeius
without having been passed in due course 01 law, and futile
materially, 101, 00 Dic Cassius (nl. 56) very wisely remarks,
those against whom it was directed, namsly, the most powerlul,
would easily get this exempticn from the people. ’11101011 was
altogether 01 little importunos ; but it shewed 1110 tactics 01
Pompeius and his party, and we must add the carelessness 01 the
Caesariana. The latter were 1101 yet thorcughly alive to tha
manoeuvres 01 their opponents.

Thus the net had been woven, and all was ready prepared in
the middle 01 May, 703 (51), when Cicero 1011110110. 000001
must be dislodged 110111 his provincial governcrship 11 possible on
March lst, 705 (49), and 1101 allowed to stand for the consulship
in his absence; and at tho very worst hs must bc dislodged before
the end 011110 year; this was simply assential to the plana 01 ths
optimates It was on those points that the constituticnal contest
was 10 be fought: 110 have 11011 10 000 how that contest proceeded.

1110 Gonsuls 101 1110 year 703 (51) were M. Claudius Marcellus
and Servius Sulpicius Rufus. The former was the ideal oi the

better class 01 01101001010, rather heavy, perhaps, but a man 011110 ,

highest character, and perieotly true 10 his principles; therefore a
resolute enemy 01 Caesar. Sulpicius Rufus was a cautious lawyu,
who, with great impartiality, and accordingly little influence,
contented himself with waming the aristocrats not to carry things
with 100 high a hand (sea especially Fam. iv. 3. 1). Heia
chiefly known 1ο posterity 101 the letter 01 consolation hs wrote tc
Oicero on the death of Tullia, which has supplied Byrcn witha
subject 101 ons 01 his finsst passages (Fam. 11. e: cp. Byrcn,
Ohildc Harcld, iv. 44:

‘Wandering in youth 1 traoed the path 0111111
The Roman friend 01 Rome's least mortal mind’)
