§2 MARCUS CAELI US RUFUS. li

Bauli in Campania, where he appears to have lived in great
povsrtyr Valerius Maximus (iv. 2. 7) tells a story of the sequel
of this trial, which shows the character of (laelius in a good light.
The mother of Pompeius Rufus was Cornelia, daughter of Sulla.
She would not return to her son in his misfortune some property
entrusted to her saie-heeping. Pompeius had the magnanimity to
write to Caelius to ask his help in this matter. Even a less im·
pulsive nature than that of Caelius could not have refused such a
request—a violent political opponent, who had directly caused
another's exile, is appealed to by that exile to help him against
his unnatural mother. We are told, and can well believe it, that
Caelius advocated his case with the utmost persistency (pertinacia-
sime), and read to the court a letter from Pompeius to show the
dire straits to which the latter had been reduced-and we are
glad to hear that he achieved a complete success, ‘an act,’ says
Valerius, ‘which on account of its remarkable generosity and
follow·feeling is not to be disregarded even though done by a
(laelius' (propter samiam humanitatem aa cub Caelio quidem repa· Α
dicacium).

In August of this year 702 (52) the law called that of the Ten
Tribunos was passed notwithstanding the violent opposition of
(lato. We shall have occasion to spealr ol it in the next section.
Here we allude to it only to notice that (laelius had intended to
vato it; for with his far-sightedness in politice he saw then, as
Cicero did afterwards, that it was an enactment fraught with the
greatest danger to the Senatorio] party. It was the seed, says
Lange (a. Α. iii. 369), from which the Oivil War sprang. But
Pompeius, delighted lor the present to be rid of Caesar, com-
missioned Cicero to dissuade (laelius from the course he had
intended to pursue,† and the law passed as that of the Ten
Tribunos.

(laelius' correspondenoe with (licere begins in the middle of
703 (51). At that time (laelius was canvassing for the cumle
aediloship, his competitors being Octavius and Hirrus. The
former was sure of election: the latter was a ridiculous though
not altogether uninfluential personss Caelius is always gibing at
