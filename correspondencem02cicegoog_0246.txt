ΤΠ letters ol tho oarlior port of thio year dosoribo tho olooing months of
oioero’s provinoial administration, an aooount of whioh is given in tho intro-
duotion. Tho Erotio o long interesting ond admirably written letter to Cato.
Tho letters ol tho latter part of tho year deal with tho events whioh immodi-
ttoly preceded tho outbroak of tho Civil War. We hear in thom tho palloring
of tho first dropo of tho thunderstorm. Politioo, and tho hopes and soors about
hia triumph, were so ongroosing at this timo that Cioero found no loiouro for
liternry work. Tho most intorosling oiroumotanoo in his privato lifo was tho

marriage of hio daughlor Tullio with Dolabella.
