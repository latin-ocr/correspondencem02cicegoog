such was virtually an attack on the oommonvvealth, Caesar he
declared a publio enemy, and the legions at Capua be at once
sent against him under the command of Pompeius. Ourio,in reply,
proved the whole story to be groundless, aad vetoed the consul's
motion. A violent debate ensued, in the course of which Appius
Claudius, the censor, formally exprossed his consorial judgment cl
Curio. Thea Ourio, with fine theatrical effect, 1001 his clothes in
bitterness and indignation oi spirit. And when Marcellus, thinking
indirectly to get a vote against Caesar, put the question ss tc
whether, having regsrd 10 the censor’s judgment of Ourio's
character, the Senate would not express some opinion cn his
persistent and vexatious use of the tribunician intercession, 00110
