The reason was as follows r-When Pompeius, Crassus, and
Caesar made their compact at Luca it was arranged that Caesar
should get an extensicn of his government for five years, that is,
as we said, till March lst, 705 (49); and that 0111110 triumvirs’
influencc should be used tc secure his electior to the consulship
for 706 (48). This agreement, virtually, though not explicitly, “
assured Caesar possession of his provincial government till the end
cf 705 (49) : for it was customary, according to the Oornelian law
010. Gracchus, that the Sancte, prior tc the electior of consuls,

But there 1100 been changes 011100 698 (56). Pompeius had
