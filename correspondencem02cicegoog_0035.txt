xxx INTRODUOTIOM

lor the 48 per oent. whioh was in the bond. Oioero peremptorily
refused to take oognizanee oi suoh a bend, pointing out that the
deoree ol tho Senate at best only plaood the eontraot between
Scaptius and tho Salaminiam on the same footing as other oon·
tracta but oould not legalise a bond in whioh the rate of interest
oharged was distinotly illegal. Upon this Soaptius gave up all
thoughts of ooeroing his debtors under Oioero's government‚ know·
ing perhaps that under his suooeseor he would probably get what·
ever he demanded, or, possibly, struok witha sudden and shortlived
oompunotion. Oonsoienoe is sometimes seen to take up her abode
for a short sojourn in the most unexpeoted quarters. For the
present he only asked that the matter should be allowed to drop,
and that the Salaminians should not be permitted to deposit the
money in atemple, whioh they were ready to do; ior the effeot oi
this would be that the interest would oease to aeoruo, and Soaptius
did not wish to diminish the sum whioh he probably hoped to
extort under Cieero's suooessor.

By this time Oioero had disoovered that Brutus was the real
oreditor 3 indeed, the gentle Brutus had urged Oioero to confer on
Soaptius the preleoture whioh he had refused him, and whioh
Scaptius had made so effeotive in the blookade of the Senate
House; aud had written several letters offensive in tone complain-
iug of his advooaoy of the rights of the Salaminians. Even
Atticus now begs his deur friend to let Scaptius have a troop ol
horse, only a little one, just fifty swords, whioh he felt sure would
melre the Salaminians see reason. It is pleasant to observo that
Cicero is nearly as indignant as we leel ourselves at the audaoity
ol suoh a request:

‘What' he writes,' ‘ you, Atticus, make suoh e request? Yon, the eulogist
ol my integrity and moral purism? Are those the lips to dare, es Ennius says,
to ask me to give Scaptius a troop of horse to ooeroe his debtorsl’ Only fifty,
you say. Why, Spartaous had no more at first!

However, the issue of the whole matter was some ooneession to ’
injustioe on the part oi Oioero. He prevailed on the Salaminiam,
as a favour to himself, to let the matter rest ior the present, and
not to deposit tho money. He salvad his oonsoienoe by appealiug
