xviii INTRODUOTION.

baolr to Rome makes even Oioero's return journey seem slew by
eomparison. What with waiting 111 Pomptinus, and spending
three days at Tarentum in eonferenoe with Pompeius on affairs
1111111, Gioero did not arrive 11 Brundisium 1111 May 22. Then,
again, where was Pomptinus? How oould one leave Italy without
Pomptinus? Moreover, the weather was not inviting, and Oioero
was not very well. In short, June had begun before he set sail-
without Pomptinus. The voyage to Aetium, broken at Ooroyra
and Sybota, where Oioero and his 11111 ‘feasted like aldermen’ ⁴*
with Areus and Eutyohides, friends 11 Attious, oooupied about a
fortnight. The next stage was to ba Athens. Tha route by sea
was mueh shorter, but it was tiresome, and ‘it would 1111 look well
to arrive with so small a flotilla! It was better 11 take the longer
route by land. They did so, and arrived at Athens in ten days,
June 24th. Again we are surprised at the intellectuat apathy 11
011111. Η1 had not seen Athens 111111 he was little more than a
boy, yet the oity suggests to him nothing bnt the 1111 that his
friend Atticus used to live there, and his thoughts fly 111111 11
Rome, Gaesar’s debts‚ Milo's embarrassments, the 1111111111· 111111
soram and the 1111111111. In 1111, 11 does not appear that he would
have made any sojourn in Athens at all, exeept ot oourse beeause
one must wait 111 Pomptinus. Here, however, Oieero found him·
self obliged to renew an aequaintanee with one who belonged to 1
class characteristio 11 sooiety just before the 1111 ofthe Republio.
The notorious Memmius, one 11 the parties to the inlamous oom-
11111 made with the outgoing consuls in 54, (700)† was now
living in Greeoe, an exile. He had beoome possessed 11 some
premises hallowed tor the Epioureans by the 1111 that they had
11111 belonged to the Master himself. 1111 disciples ot Epiourus,
Patro and others now living in Athens, besought the good offioes
11 Gioero with Memmius, to seoure 111· them thess promisee.
Memmius is bnt little oonoemed. The poem whioh Lueretius
dedioated to him does not seem to have awakened in him any
interest in Epicurus or 1111 house. Perhaps he had never read the
poem. Oieero tells us‡ that Memmius was ‘thoroughly versed in
literature, but only in Greek literature; Latin he despised.' We
are gratified (perhaps more than Oioero was) to find Pomptinus at

'Selureminmodum 1111111111). 1111111111). 1111111.
