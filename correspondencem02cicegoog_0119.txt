UORRESPONDENUE.

EPP. cmxlii-ccxxxvn.

————-————

A. o. c. ⁷⁰³3 n. c. 513 sor. cic. 55.

COSS M. CLAUDIUS MARCELLUS AND SERVIUS SULPICIUS RUFUS.

Olcnio goes to his province, Cilioio. The Letters of this year deal chiefly
with the inoidents of his provincial life¹ which was very distorteiul to him.
We olso find him during this yeor annoyed by o misunderstanding with
Appius, his predecessor in the government of Cilioio; ond by o growing
distrust oi Philotimus, o freedman of Terentio‘o. This ond the next four
years seem to hove been quito barren of literory produot. No work, either
extant or lost, is ascribed to ibis period of tho life of Cicero.
