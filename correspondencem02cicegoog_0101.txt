xeri INTRODUOTION.

story (oie. Off. iii. 82) that Caesar orer had in his mouth the linos
of Euripides (Phoen. sal-5)-

εἴπερ γὰρ ἀδικεῖν χρὴ τυραννίδος πέρι
κάλλιστον ἀδικεῖν, τᾶλλα δἐὺσεβεῖν χρεών-

is probably true, and shows that his great intolleot did not doooire
itself. But to know that one is doing wrong does not losson,
but rather aggravatos the wrong ; then indeed is iniquity trium·
phant.

Το resume. When Caesar, at Ravenna, learned what had
been done at Rome, feeling that promptitudo of aetion was essen·
tial, he at oneo put his plans in operation. On the l2th0113th
of J anuary he oallod together the thirteenth legion, and set before
thom the nature of the orisis. He pointed out how his enemios
had wronged him, how they had misled and corrupted tho oharsoter
of Pompeius; how jealous the latter had orer beon and how gene·
rous he himself3 how tho tribunes had beon oompollod to fly from
the city because they exereisod the right ol vete, a right left
untouohed even by Sulla3 how the nobles had aoted with unpro-
oedented and unjust violenoe in passing the final dooroe whioh
deolared tho eity in danger3 and he eonoludod by an appeal to his
oomrades in arms, ashing them as their general, who for nino
years had lod them from vietory to vietory till all Gaul and
Germany wore subdued, now that his dignity and reputation were
being assailed, to lond him onoe more their faithful aid and to
defend him from his onemies. With a ohoer the soldiers promised
to protect from all herm their general and tho tribunes of the
poople? and lorthwith tho order for moreh to Ariminum was

given, in the oourse of whieh maroh the proconsul of Gaul would
pass the little stream of the Rubicon, whioh was the lirnit of his
authority. That orossed, he had transgressed the laws, and as a

revolutionary leader was bearing arms against his oountry. The
Civil War had begun.
