decreed another and a sadder connexion between Curio and that
ἰ
lan‘lllhe laws, ol course, were opposed: Ourio expected es muoh.

But that did not satisly him; he must ereate fresh grievanoes. It
was the oustom that there should be an interealary mouth inserted

Memmius to gettha house for the Epicureens. Cicero wrote an admirable letter (Ep.
cxcix), composedwith great aare, toMemmius esking him if, now that he has given up his
proieet of building on the spot, he eould see his way to letting the Society have the
house; their earneslness in this matter (he says)is rather laughable, but they aro an
innocent, simple-minded set; and we Romans should indulge them, for their error, sueh
aa it is, is one of silliness not knavery. We do not know whether they got the house
or not With the exception ot two short letters ot Cicero written to him in 704 (50)
viz. Fam. xiii. 2. 3, Epp. cclix„ oola, and Curio's proposed law that he should be
restored from exile, we hear uo more about Memmius.

He appears to have been a good specimen ol the ordinary active politieiaa ol his
time, vigorous aad unscrupulous, but perhaps neither better nor worse than the average
otthone around him. He was o very proud Roman noble, his family traoing its origin to
Trojan times (Serv. on Aen. v. 117), and testilying toits entiquity by stamping tho head
ol Romulus on their eoins. Mommsen (op. eit. ii. p. tlt) sees in this claim the point
ol Catullus, xxviii. un. opprobia Romuli lienique, as applied to Memmius and Piso-for
the Calpurnii derived their deseent from Numa (Plut. N um. 21) as the Memmii did
lrom Romulus (or Mnestheus or Assaracus, Verg. Aen. xii. 127), but the Memmii do
not appear to have beeome aoliks tilla comparatively late period. This pride of birth,
however, which they affected, no doubt mede (lieero very eareful as regards the tono he
adopted in writing to Memmius. Oieero, iu another place (Brut. 247), speaks of him
as well-versed in Greek literature but despising Latin, ond as a voluble and pleasing
speaker, but aa ona who did not take any trouble about his speaking, ereren about
considering what he was going to say. Like so many of his contemporaries he
eomposed verses ol a lieentious nature (cp. Ov. Trist. ii. 433, Quid referam Ticidae,
quid Memmi earmina, apud quos Rebus adest nomen nominibusque pudor ; Plin.
Rp. v. 3. 6); but he took no trouble with these either, lor they were afterwards
judgsd to be ‘rough' (duro) productione (Gell. xix. 9. 7). Lueretius addressed the De
Rerum Natura to this Memmius ; aad Martha (p. ol) thinks that tho many tino
passages in that poem referring to the miserias of ambition erespeeially addressed to
him. ¹ Munro remarks that it is notieeable that on all the coins of the Memmii we fiad
Venas crowned by Ieve, which gives speeiel point to the lines i. 26-27: Memmiadae
nostro quem tu, dee, tempore in omni Omnibus ornatum voluisti excellere rebus.

⁸ op. ans. Bell. civ. ii. 25; Dio (lass. xli. 41, 425 also Lucan iv. 688:

Privatae sed bella dabat Iuba concitus irae.

Hune quoque, quo superos humanaque polluit enno,
Lege tribunicia solio depellere avorum

Curio tentarat, Libyamque auferre tyranno,

Dum regnum te, Roma, lacit.

Libycas an nobile eorpus
Praeterea, nullo eouwetus Curio busto.
