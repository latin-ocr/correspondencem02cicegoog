lxxxii INTRODUOTION.

puazled (laelius (Fam. viii. 6. 4, Ep. ooxlii.).* In 1116 usual
lashion he shut himself up, this time in a well-fortified and well·

provisioned town, and stayed there while the slightest rumour
subsisted that the Parthians were still in his provinoe. He does

not appear 16 have oven observed 116 16616116 61 issued 11161116-
ohian ediots.† But he was a 6616 1616 16 116 6111161116 party

against Cassan 11616111 lay the Perfeot Wisdom3 and 1ο an
orthodox Stoio like 0616, 1161 61 6611166 guaranteed military
effieienoy, personal oovuage, and all the other virtues.

The other was from Pompeius. It was an able and judioious
letter, owing to its apparent moderation. He was willing 16
161116 before his time 116111 command 61 116 army if 1116111616
should require it; and therein was far more eonstitutional than
066661, who was not vvilling to 161116 61611 long after his legal
tenure 61 governorship should expire. Pompeius stated the same
on his return to Rome in June. But Curio had a ready reply.
These were all mere promises. Lot 1611 161116 61 both hold their
armies: by no other means oould the equilibrium 61 parties 16
preserved, and the State romain saie-and Ourio was able to urge
this with irresistible 16166, for 11 was the simple truth. Cato,
oourageous as ever, tried 1ο hold popular meetings and 16 put
1116 Senate’s 6666 161616 116 people ; but he effeeted nothingss

During May there was a debate on the sending 61 1611116166·
1116111616 Syria to 1666 1116 threatened Parthian invasion. Curio,
who would seem to have got into the habit 61 instinctively vetoing
every proposal, vetoed this; as he did also a motion granting pay
to Pompeius’ soldiers. But ha gave up the opposition next month,
and was considered to have aoted wisely in doing 66. Ι1 was then
deereed that both Caesar and Pompeius should give each 6 legion
161 Syria. Pompeius asked back the legion whioh he had lent to
Caesar. Caesar 61 61166 returned 11 and 66111 6166 116 fifteenthlegion
61 his own army, 61161 giving offioers and soldiers 61 1611 large
rewards and thanking them for their services. These legions were
stationed 61 Capua and 1161 66111 16 Syria 61 all-a oiroumstanee
whioh was used to fasten a charge 61 bad 16111 on the Pompeiana.
