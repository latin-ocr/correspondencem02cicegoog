Here it will be seen that there is a
kind cf play on the two meanings οὶ
datm rationem, which means-(l) ‘tc
magnios as a candidate for office! (2)
‘to have some consideration lor! The
tlrst use of the phrase is familiar in
she letters of this time; the second is
illustrated b the passages quoted at the
beginningo this note, ay. Att. viii. ll,
D. 7, duxi sacam raticrrem= mili constitui,
‘I took my own interests into account.'

amnia cclplarima et onustam, remarks that
in that passage and the present, which
he adducas, Cicero uses aet . . . cet where
we should have expected aat . . . aat;
and says that the use cl eet. . ,τοι seems
to show that there is notbin tc choos·
between the alternatives. but in the
lilithtiintstlsstelhillidl⁰l⁰r
such things as are according to nature-
‘all ot them, or should 1 rather say, the
most and best ot them’ P Moreover, it is
to be noted that in this passage the
alternativcs arc not incompatible. It
would have been possible that the
Pompeiane should wiu, and that Cicero,
cr any given Pompeian, might die in the
struggle, and not outlive republicanism.
He might even mean ‘we hare good
hopes ot conquering, or (shall 1 say even
a greater thing i) of seeing the republio
outlast us! We do not think these two
passages are sufficient to upset the uni-
versal applicationes the rule regulating
the use of aret ...aut and vel. ..eet;
and we do not regard thern as prcvingthat
ael . . . cel may be applied tc two incom-
patible alternativcs, instead of cert . ..
aut.

qno tempore] ‘the time of the struggle
depende on chance ; the plan tebe adopted
in it depende cn the circumstances of
the time when it begins) ‘This remark,'
observes ΜΓ. Wutson, ‘was verified bv
the event. 'l‘he senate, by sending Caesar
adefiance at Pcrupey'e suggestion before
the Italian levies had resembled, made it
impossible to defend Rome!
