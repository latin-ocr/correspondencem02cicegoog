'l'he man who could write that invective against Antonius
was not merely a great orator, he was also a great personality'3
but just at this period olbis life he oame in oontaot with a far
greater personality than himself, with the celebrated Clodia.
‘The Palatina Medea,' lately awidow, was leading at this time
a brilliant but wildly dissolute life. Report maintained that she
had poisoned her husband, and she was considered capable of any
¹crime. Rich, cultivated, attractiva, lasciviens, terriblo, she was
the head of a brilliant society in which all the young men who
possessed any graoe or oharm were gathered, among them the

unhappy Catullus. He has immortalized this Clodia, this Lesbia,
in his passionate verses, verses passionatein love and hate; but

‘the gods approve
The depth and not the tumult of tha soul,
A fervent not ungovernable love,'

and he died broken-heartod by his own extravagant passione, and
by herfaithlessness and cruelty. clodia was the oentre of the whole
throng. Known to us as she is only from her enemies-three
as great masters of invective as over lived, Catullus, Caelius, Cicero
-the very bitterness of their onslaughts testifica to the greatness
oi her personality, a personality of which none ean read without
feeling its power and intensity, though but one or two of the facts
oi her life are to be seen, and that fitfully, through the virulenoe of
her foes, like a wild revel in the night revealed by flashes ol
lightning. Itis strange that none ol our novolists or imaginative
writers have taken as their subject this brilliant oirole, and given
body and substance to the intrigues and plots, the banquets and
revels, the singingparties, and the yaohting parties, the life in
Clodia's mansion and gardana on the Palatina and by the
shore and on the waters at Baiae.† Not even does Cleopatra
