xlii IN TROD UOTI ON.

in order to qualify for the triumph which an optimate was sure
01 obtaining in those bad times. But he got ‘very drunk aud
incapable the night before the battle andin consequence was ,
defeated. The description given by (laelius 01 Antonius’ state when
the enemy attached is preserved by Quintilian (iv. 2. 123). ¹ It is
no doubt highly coloured, indeed perhaps all colour, and not very
agracable‚ but itis one 01 the strongest and most striking pictures
in literature :— '

N amque ipsum offendunt temulento sopore profligatum, totis praecordiis
stertentem, ructuosos spiritus geminare, praeclarasque contubernales ab
omuibus spondis transversas incubare 01 reliquas circumiacere passim: quae
tamen exanimatae terrore, hostium adventu percepto, excitare Antonium
conabantur, nomen inclamabant, frustra a cervicibus tollebant, blandius
alia ad aurem invocabat, vehementius etiam nonnulla feriebat: 000000
cum omnium rocem tactumque noscitaret, proximae cuiusque collum am·
plexu petebat: neque dormire excitatus neque vigilare ebrius poterat, sed
semisommo sopore inter manus centurionum concubinarumque iactabatur.

‘There could 001 10,’ says Quintilian, ‘ 0 more striking represen-
tation, 0 more soathing attach, or a more realistis picture’*
Biting sarcasm was the characteristic 01 caelium He was
accordingly pre-eminent as 00 accuser, his specohcs when acting
on the defensive being apparently rather tame productione. Quin·
tilian (vi. 3. 69) tellshow Cicero expressed this by 00 allegory, when
he said that (laelius had 0 good right hand but a bad 1011 000, ι’. 0.
0 good swerd-hand but a bad shield-hand. Cicero also says 01
Caelius that his pleadings were set off by 0 brilliant and large yet
at the same time pre-eminently witty and most satirical style 01
oratory.‡ No wonder then that he was rcckoncd as 00001 the
grem oratore 01 that period, the golden age 01 Roman oratery,

⁸* Nihil his 00000 credibilius fingi neque vehementius exprobrari neque manifestius
ostendi poterat.

Sed aliud est maledicere aliud accusare. Accusatio crimen desiderat, rem ut definiat,
hominem ut notet argumento probet teste confirmet. Maledictio autem nihil habet
praepositi praeter contumeliam, quae si petulantius iactatur convicium, si facetius
