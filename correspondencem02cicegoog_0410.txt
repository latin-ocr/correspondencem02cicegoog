Under the Empire a minimum was fixed by the LexJulia ol 136 (19 6. 6.) : 666 Dio

Tun 11666666 were called ἀνάκλητοι 16 Greek. The ancients (especially Servius on Verg.
Aen„ viii. 1) distinguished three kinds oi service-(l) 66966666 militia, or sacramentum
(2) tumultus ,· (3) evocatio ,· but logically, 66 Mommsen has pointed out (apa. Epiqr„
v. 142) 616 division should 16 66666·6666666 service, comprising ornamentum and
tumultur, and voluntary service. Those who served in the latter were the Eooeatt.
Itwas originally only in periods of great crisis (Serv. on Aen. vii. 614) that such asum·
mons to arms was mude; and 6166 666 bya magistrate, but by any man oi spirit and in·
tluenee who called on those who wished their country’ssaiety toiollow him. Accordingto
strict legal right these volunteers were not soldiera, but pro 6661666066 (Serv. on Aen. ii.
167) ς they did not serve in a legion or cohart, they had no definite leaders, nor 166
they any right to demand pay, though probably they always received rewards in lurger
measure than the ordinary soldiers—eertainly they did 6ο in later times (Caes. lloll.
(liv. i. 3, 2: cp. Mommsen, ap. eit, 143, note 1). But afterwards it became 616
practice tor generals, no longer in the name oi the State, hut in their own name, to
invite, as a rule specially (sauriciacum, 0666. Bell. Gall. iii. 20, 2) veterana (Bell. Civ.
i, 3, 2) 66 renew their service. These Evocats' stood in rank above tho ordinary soldiera,
probably on a level with the centurione (0666. Bell. civ.. i. 17, 4; iii. 63, 1; 91, 1,
vell. ii. 70, 3, compared with Dto (lass. 6161146, 4); they were probably only

note 6), and were provided with horses on the march (0666. Bell. Gall. vii. 66, 6). We
find such troops as these in the time oi Flamininus (Plut. Flam. ³3 Livy xxxii. 3, 6),
Marius (Sall. J ug. 84, 2), Catilina (16. 066. 69, 3), 016666 (Fam. xv. 4, 3, Ep. ccxxxviii),
Caesar (besides the passages already quoted, cp. 0. 1. L. X. 3666, 6011), Octavian
(016 Gaas. xlv. 12, 3). They played 6 wusiderable part in the civil wara, but seldom
