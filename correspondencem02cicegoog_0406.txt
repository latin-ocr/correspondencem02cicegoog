of children and slaves (exactio capitum atqua ιιιιιιιιιι, Cic. Fam. iii. 8, 5, with reference
ιο Cilicia; φόροι lrl τῇ γῇ και τοῖς σώμασιν, App. Pun, 135, with reference to
Ainos). In accordsnoe with this regrdstiou, ιιι magicatos of each commuuity,
undar ιιι superintendence of ιιι Roman governor (Cio. Q. Fr. i. 1. 8. uo; S. C. de
Asclepiade, 22, 23 = Wordsworth‚ p. 208), settled who were ιο pay the ιιι, aud what
vas to be paid by each individual (imperata ἑπικιφιίλιι, cic. ιιι. v. 16. 2): if suy-
one did not pay this in proper time, ιιι tax-debt was sold just as at Roma, ι’. s. it was

= handod ovar ιο a contractor with an adjudication to collect it (venditio tributorum, (lic.

Fam. ιιι. 8, b: ιἰνιι emolumentium, cie. Art. v. 16. 2).”

On this ιι may ba remarked-(l) that the poll-tux and door-tax (virtually family·
ιιι, each family which lived in a house having ι separate door: see Huschke, Census
aad Steasrcersasrusy‚ Note 224) ιιι rather ιο ιι regarded ιι special kinds of extortion
practised by Appius and the other uncorupulous governors‚ and surely felt. We hear
of ιιι poll-tax as continued afterwards in the time of Hadrian (App. Syr. ιθ,
και διὰ ταῦτα ἔστιν Ἰουδαίοις ἅπασιν d φόροι τῶν σωμάτων βαρύτιρος τῆς ἄλλης
πιριουσίις’ ἔστι distel Σύροις ιιι Κίλιξιν ἐτήσιοι, {carcaria τοῦ τιμήματος ἑκάστῳ),
ιιι probably ιιι ι milder form. There were somewhat similar extortions practised by
Scipio in Asia in 706 (48 a.c.): ιιι Cacsar Bell. civ. ιιι. 32, “ iuterim acerbissime
imperatae pecuniae tota provincia exigebantur. Multa practerea generatim udaveritisnr
excogitabantur. In capito singula servorum ac liberorum tributum imponebatur.
columnaria, ostiaria, frumentum, milites, remiges, arma, tormenta, vecturae impera·

Mnrqusrdt, St. V. ii², 197 ff.¹

(2) Τιι words imperato ιιιιιιιφιιια probably refer ιο this extortionate poll-tax,
and not to the partition among the various individuale of the lump-sum at which each
of the various states was assemed by tha Roman settlement·officer.

(3) Mommsen's view of venditio tributorum, ιἰνιι omnium venditae, seems tha right
one. The contractor would pay up the sum at which the States wera ιιιιιιιι, and
afterwards ertort it by degrees with, doubtlesa‚ a good interest. There iano need to
suppose, ou the basis of App, Mithr. 8³‚2 that the ιιι on doors was peculiar ιο ιιι
Διιιιιι dioceses. It and the poll-tax were rather extortions of Appius and those lilse
him (cp. quam ιιι non ignoras),
