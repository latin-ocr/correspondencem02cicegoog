ciale to be obliged to give up their employments and risk their
lives so that (laelius might put himself in the running for the
consulship, on winning which he would again look to the province
to reimburse himself for his expenditure on the Aedilis gemes.

‘chcver‚' writes Cicero,' ‘I am doing my best through the shikarees, but
tigers are very scaros, and, he adds jestingly, ‘those that- are to the iore think
it very hard that they should be the only creatures under my rule of whom an
unfair advantage has been taken, and have resolved tc leave my province and
emigrato into Caria!

But Caelius by no means conteuted himself with such moderate
demands as these. He had the audacity to ask his friend to
impose a tax on the province to defray the whole expenses of
his entertainment in Rome. Of this ceetipcl editicium, Cicero
had written to his brother Quintus† nine years before :-

‘How much credit you deserve for delivering your province from that
oppressive aud iniquitous exaction‚ though it did cause heartburnings against
us in high quartersl If one magnate complains openly thot your decree has
taken 200,000 sesterces out cf his pocket, what would be the sum paid by the
provinces if they were taxed for everyone whc gave shows at Rome-aud that
was the practice which wes rapidly becoming established!

Perhaps it was a recollection of this letter which dictated the
courteous sternuess oi his refusal: ‘Icould not raise this money in

such away, nor, if I were minded to do so, could you accept it.'‡
A similar dignity displays itself in his dismissal of the brutal
Gavius. Cicero, it seems, in spite of his practice of refusing the
office of prefect to men engaged in benking business and broking‚

had, however, at the request of the noble Brutus, conferred that
appointment on this Gavius, and on one Scaptius, not apparently
the hero oi the Salaminiam episode, but probably as great a ruffian.
Oicero palliated to himself this concession by the reflection, that
these men did not carry on their business in his own province, but
in Cappadocia. However he had resson to regnet his complaisanoe.

‘One cauny he writes tc Atticus,§ ‘to whom I give a prefecture at the
requmt of Brutus, is habitually disrespectful to me in his words and demsmour.
A sort of spaniel of Clodius he is. He did not attend me when I left Apamea;
