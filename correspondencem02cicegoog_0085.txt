worn out with worry and vexation that he was compelled, at tha
beginning of April, to leave Rome for Naples, where he tell
dangerously ill. So nothing definite could be settled.

During the mouth of April a letter written in February
arrived lrom Cicero to the Senate aelring for a supplicatio in
honour ot his exploits on the Amanus* Ourio opposed the grant.
He said he had the highest respect and admiration for (licere, bnt
he was afraid that this repetebatis would be used by his opponente
to wrest some more comitial days from him. It was no doubt a
troublesome huot, and had to be untied by a compromise, it being
agreed that the arcppb'calio should be granted, but not till the
ensuing year. ‘The attack,' says anlius (Fam. viii. ll. l,
Ep. cclxvii), ‘was short but sharp.' In the course of it Cornelius
Balbus, (laesar’s accredited agent, said to (lario that Caesar would
not be at all pleased with his action in this matter-a remark
which gave considerable support to the opinion that Onne was
acting in ansar's interest, and that Caesar was well-disposed
to Cicero's claime.

But Curio had now to turn his attention to the plausible pro·
posal ol Pompeius that Caesar should resign his command on the
‚rath of November, 705 (49). It had, as we have said, a great
show ot lairness‚ but Ourio saw that it must be hindered at all
riske. He did not fear opposition, he rather courted it. The
Senate, however, was opposed to deoided measures. ‘Here is the
oase,’ says anlius, with his usual clearness of vision ; ‘I tell you
this: it they coerce Ourio in everything, Caesar will defend his
tribunieian authority: if, as seems the case, they shrink from that,
Caesar will stay in command of the army ae long as he likes'

· This letter is not extant, but a substitute is the long letter to Cato (Fam. xv. 4,
Ep. dcxxxviii), askingthat worthy to do what he covdd to favour the grant cf a suppli·
catio. Cato wrote in reply‚ stating that hs had opposed the grant. He says the
letter is longer than those he generally wrote3 it is really very short and very charac-
teristic, so it will not try the reader's patience ir we asli him to read it once again
(Fam. xv. t, Ep. cclxvi). Let him form what judgment on it he thinks fit; at any
rate no one can deny that Cato had the coinage of his convictione. Ilia sterling
adherenoe to his principles, such as they were, and his scrupulous honesty, pedentic
though it sometimes was, yet had its reward. Hs even came to be considered the
moral referee of the age. ‘I thinlr,’ says Cicero (att. vi. 2. 8, Ep. cclvi), ‘that
