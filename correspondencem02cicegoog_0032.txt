in the suta’* His connectione were certainly favourable for the
achievement of that position. Descended from one of the most
illustrious familias of Rome, nephew 01 Cato, brother-in-law of
Lepidus and Cassius, he could hardly point te a great house with
which 16 was not linked. The moral austerity and social purity

which distinguished the young Brutus did net extend to his family
circle. The passion of his mother Servilia for Caesar was no secret
st Rome, and hasbeen held by some te add a new significanee' to
the words ascribed to the dying Dictator, καὶ σύ, τέκνον. Servilia
iseven said te have essayed to maintain her influence over Caesar
by encouraging an intrigue between him and her daughter, the
wife of Cassius. That her other daughter, the wife of Lepidus,

wera by chance included among the assets of Pompeius Vindullus
on the death of the latter, were found images or pertrait medela
cf certain Roman ladies, whose characters would naturally suffer·
from the discovery, as Vedius was a man of the worst character.
Among these portreits was one 01 J unia, sister of Bmtus and wife
of Lepidus. Lepidus took no notice of the matter, and Brutus
did not feel called upon te break off his intimacy with Vedius.
Cicero, with acharacteristic play upon the two names, Brutus

incident :—

‘Among the belongings of Vedius (accidentally included in the assets ot‘
Vindullus) were found five pertraits of Roman ladies, among them a pertrait of
the sister of your friend Brutus-a brute part in him to keep up the iellew's
acquaintance-and wife ef Lepidus—pleasant fellew indeed to take the matter
so coelly.’ Ι
